                <h3>7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>
                <p><em>In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
                        organizational and technical security measures.
                    </em></p>
                <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational
                    security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
                    process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no
                    electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be
                    guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,
                    cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our
                    security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although
                    we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
                    information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the
                    Services within a secure environment.

                    has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to
                    promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we

                    include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your
